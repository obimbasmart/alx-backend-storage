-- Write a SQL script that creates a view need_meeting that lists all
-- students that have a score under 80 (strict) and no last_meeting or more than 1 month.
--
--     The view need_meeting should return all students name when:
--     They score are under (strict) to 80
--     AND no last_meeting date OR more than a month

CREATE VIEW need_meeting AS
SELECT name FROM students
WHERE (score < 80) && 
      (last_meeting > (UNIX_TIMESTAMP(NOW()) - (30 * 24 * 60 * 60)) ||
      last_meeting IS NULL)
